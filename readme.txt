Extends the post, page, and theme editor by adding a block visibility option based on device type. Supports mobile, tablet, and desktop.

== Description ==

This plugin extends the editor by giving support for hiding each separate block on a certain device. It offers a span for mobile, tablet, and desktop, which can be set by the site admin on the dedicated options page found on the admin panel.

It's a lightweight solution that will be expanded soon to add what we deem is missing in the default WordPress Block setup.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
